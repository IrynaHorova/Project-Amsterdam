## Project Description
In this project we aim to answer the following questions:
* Impact of festivals on surrounding area economy and at which point of a festival size the impact becomes significant

The topics we would like to cover:  
* Shops sales
* Transport traffic
* Hotel occupancy
* Airport passenger traffic


## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Learn how to work in a team.
* Fork and manage your own git repository and avoid conflicts with your teammate's code.
* Ask yourself interesting questions related to your topic.
* Search and explore data that will help you answer your questions.
* Perform a simple analysis and identify interesting insights.
* Learn something about Amsterdam!

## Data Workflow
In this project you will focus on learning and developing Data Wrangling skills.

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are:
* The project must be planned. That is why creating a Kanban board is important. You can find a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/usAykV9K/project-2-barcelona). Remember that you **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
* Your repository must be clean and organized; this means that it must include a *.gitignore* file and a README file and also have a functional file structure.
* Your README file must clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to.
* Also, mind that **NO PLOTTING IS ALLOWED IN THIS PROJECT**.
* The project needs to be presented to your colleagues on the day of the presentation.

The **mandatory** deliverables that you must turn in are:
* Link to the repository you used while working on your project. The repository must include all the files you used to complete your analysis. Remember to commit often to avoid trouble in case you mess up: this means more than 1 commit!
* Link to Trello or picture of your Kanban Board. Include the link or picture in the README file.


The **deadline** to turn in the deliverables is right before the project presentations.

## Mentoring
One of the TAs will be your mentor!

Your mentor will:
* Keep track of your project in general terms. Your mentor will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following your plan: are you keeping up with your tasks and deadlines? Do you have any obstacles blocking you?
* Help/support you with specific questions.

Your mentor is **not** meant to:
* Know everything.
* Be your manager. You have to be responsible of your own tasks!

## Schedule

**Please note** that the following schedule is simply a guideline. Feel free to organize your work as you see fit.

**Tuesday**
* Choose your topic.
* Find interesting questions related to your topic.
* Brainstorm to find out what kind of data you can use to answer those questions.
* Research and look for the data you need. You can find some useful links to investigate in the ```Resources``` section.
* Fork the project repository and edit the README Deoverview. You can find a [template](https://github.com/ta-data-bcn/Project-Week-2-Barcelona/blob/master/your-project/README.md) for your README file in this repository. Remember to keep the README up-to-date.

**Wednesday**
* Plan your project. Remember that we are providing you with a Trello [template](https://trello.com/b/usAykV9K/project-2-barcelona). Define tasks, specifying those to be done individually and those to be done together. Remember that you **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
* Once you finish, start coding!
* Clean your data.

**Thursday**
* Analyze your data.
* Find the most interesting and meaningful insights.
* Start preparing the slides for Friday's presentation.

**Friday**  
* Presentation time at **3 PM**! There will be a 15-minute break during the presentations.

## Presentation
The presentation time limit is **10 minutes**! After all the presentations are over, there will be a 5-minutes break. After the break, we will hold a short debate about the projects.

Our suggestion is to include at least the following slides in your presentation but feel free to add or remove slides:

* Title of the project
* Team presentation
* Goals of the project
* Data - sources, problems and limitations
* Database - data wrangling/cleaning and database structure
* Main insights
* Questions you were not able to answer and why
* Learnings

**Remember to present your insights as understandably as possible without using plots!**

## Tips & Tricks
* Questions first. Data second.
* Think about the workflow of your analysis BEFORE starting to code.
* You will have more questions than answers. It's not a problem if you can't answer some or any of your questions. Just show us why you couldn't answer them, that itself will be interesting!

## Asking Questions
Imagine that our project is about the population of Barcelona.
We could, for example, try to answer a *descriptive* question such as: How many people are living in my neighborhood? In this case you will simply need to find data that can directly answer your question.
Let's instead assume that your question is an *analytic* one such as: Is my neighborhood the best? In this case you will need to think what the word *best* means in this context. For example it could mean:
* Safer
* More cultural events
* More schools
* ...

Analytic questions require you to think about the *how* of answering a question.
This is one of the most interesting parts of the process and you will be doing it for the rest of the bootcamp (and most likely for the rest of your career as a data analyst).
