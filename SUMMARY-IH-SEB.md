## Project Description
In this project we aim to answer the following questions:
* Does investment in sport positively impact % of people actively participating in sport
* Does investment in sport positively impact general population health
* Does investment in sport impact labour market

The topics we would like to cover:  
* Number and percent of people participating in sport
* Deaths from cardiovascular issues
* Number and percent people employed in sport


## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Learn how to work in a team.
* Fork and manage your own git repository and avoid conflicts with your teammate's code.
* Ask yourself interesting questions related to your topic.
* Search and explore data that will help you answer your questions.
* Perform a simple analysis and identify interesting insights.
* Learn something about Amsterdam!

## Data Workflow
In this project you will focus on learning and developing Data Wrangling skills.

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are:
* The project must be planned. [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/v7RclC6d/project-amsterdam-sebastien-iryna)
* Your repository must be clean and organized; this means that it must include a *.gitignore* file and a README file and also have a functional file structure.
* Your README file must clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to.
* Also, mind that **NO PLOTTING IS ALLOWED IN THIS PROJECT**.
* The project needs to be presented to your colleagues on the day of the presentation.

The **mandatory** deliverables that you must turn in are:
* Link to the repository you used while working on your project. The repository must include all the files you used to complete your analysis. Remember to commit often to avoid trouble in case you mess up: this means more than 1 commit!
* Link to Trello or picture of your Kanban Board. Include the link or picture in the README file.


## Datasets

* [Public Subsidy Register Amsterdam](https://data.amsterdam.nl/datasets/yvlbMxqPKn1ULw/openbaar-subsidieregister-amsterdam/)

## Presentation
The presentation time limit is **10 minutes**! After all the presentations are over, there will be a 5-minutes break. After the break, we will hold a short debate about the projects.

Our suggestion is to include at least the following slides in your presentation but feel free to add or remove slides:

* Title of the project
* Team presentation
* Goals of the project
* Data - sources, problems and limitations
* Database - data wrangling/cleaning and database structure
* Main insights
* Questions you were not able to answer and why
* Learnings

**Remember to present your insights as understandably as possible without using plots!**
